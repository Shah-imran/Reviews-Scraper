Lorraine Loxleigh,I enquired about a S.E.N course.,A day ago,"I enquired about a S.E.N course.
Reading through all the literature regarding the course, they start by telling you how you need to take this course and how it benefits you for working within the S.E.N sector. Then they say that its not a qualification, It certainly is misleading.
So i asked how the course will be of any good for me and still waiting for a response, They say that someone will answer within two days... For me its been 6 and still no answer,
I, personally do not trust this organisation.",1

Michaela,They want extra money for certificates,Updated 15 hours ago,"I did the forensic psychology course and a bunch of others about two weeks ago now, I have heard nothing about the marketing of the assignments but they don't get back to you. Also, they were sneaky and will try get extra money from you for the certificate even though the e-certificate is included. I ordered the ecertificate as I had passed the test then when I persued them they said I had to pay for the certificate but its included in the course price.
Also, when you try verify your certificate online if you put in the number it does not make sense because the distinction is missing this looks so unprofessional if someone is verifying your certificate. I wasted my time doing a bunch of their courses as they said they would fix this problem for me. I werent get my time back but I may get my money back from my credit card provider as they have not supplied the service agreed. They lost a very good customer who would have done lots more courses but once they have your money they either try get more for a certificate and transcript or they just do not reply. Had enough of them now. Very annoyed I would avoid.",1
Jos B,Doesn't seem legit...,"Updated Jan 5, 2020","I went for the Mental Health Support Worker Training Level 3 course, the questions in the final exam were badly written and some just didn't make sense... I passed the exam but it didn't seem legit. But then I did buy the course through Reed, so it should be fine... Also their Facebook page looks like it's paid for 5* reviews",2
